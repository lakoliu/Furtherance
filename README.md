# Furtherance
Furtherance is a time tracking app, with a native interface on Gnome, Windows, and Mac.
It allows you to track time spent on different activities without worrying about your data being captured and sold.

**UPDATE: Furtherance is underging a complete rewrite using [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced). It will be better in many ways and contain more features, but most importantly there will be a single, cross-platform version,
so updates will be far more frequent and everyone will have the same features, regardless of OS. You can read more about the change [here](https://unobserved.io/blog/twau-1) and view the current progress in the
[iced](https://github.com/lakoliu/Furtherance/tree/iced) branch.**
